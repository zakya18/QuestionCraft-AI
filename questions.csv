Object Oriented Programming (OOPS),What is a subclass?,"A subclass is a class that inherits from another class, known as the superclass."
Object Oriented Programming (OOPS),What is a member function?,"A member function is a function that is defined within a class and operates on the class's data."
Object Oriented Programming (OOPS),What is a data member?,"A data member is a variable that is defined within a class."
Object Oriented Programming (OOPS),What is composition?,"Composition is a design principle where a class is made up of one or more objects from other classes."
Object Oriented Programming (OOPS),What is aggregation?,"Aggregation is a special form of association where one class is a part of another class."
Object Oriented Programming (OOPS),What is a static method?,"A static method belongs to the class rather than any object instance and can be called without creating an instance of the class."
Object Oriented Programming (OOPS),What is a dynamic binding?,"Dynamic binding is the process of linking a procedure call to the code to be executed in response to the call at runtime."
Object Oriented Programming (OOPS),What is a final class?,"A final class is a class that cannot be subclassed or extended."
Cloud Computing,What is cloud computing?,"Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, processing, and applications."
